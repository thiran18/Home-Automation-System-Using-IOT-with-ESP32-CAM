# Home-Automation-System-Using-IOT-with-ESP32-CAM

**Overview**

This project is an advanced IoT-based home automation system that leverages the ESP32-CAM module, Firebase for real-time database management, and a custom mobile application built using MIT App Inventor. The system allows users to remotely control home appliances, monitor real-time camera feeds, and enhance home security with motion detection and keypad access.

**Components**

 1.ESP32-CAM: A microcontroller with an integrated camera module used for streaming video, capturing images, and integrating with the home automation system.
 2.PCF8575 I/O Expander: Extends the GPIO capabilities of the ESP32-CAM for controlling multiple relays.
 3.Firebase: Real-time database for managing the state of appliances and storing camera data.
 4.MIT App Inventor: A visual programming environment used to build the mobile app for user interaction with the system.
 5.Keypad and LCD: Used for secure entry with a password-protected system and for displaying messages.
 6.Relays: For switching home appliances on and off.
 7.PIR Motion Sensor: Detects motion for security purposes.

**Features**

1.Remote Control of Appliances:

* Users can turn on/off appliances via the mobile app.
* Six relays control different home appliances.

2.Real-Time Camera Feed:

* The ESP32-CAM streams live video which can be accessed through the mobile app.
* Supports capturing images on-demand.

3.Security Features:

* Motion detection using a PIR sensor. When motion is detected, an alert can be sent to the user, and the camera can capture an image.
* Password-protected entry using a keypad. The system checks the entered password against predefined passwords and grants or denies access accordingly.

4.Real-Time Updates:

* The system uses Firebase to keep the state of the appliances updated in real-time.
* Any changes made via the mobile app are immediately reflected in the system.

**System Architecture**

1.ESP32-CAM Initialization:

* Initializes WiFi and connects to Firebase.
* Configures the camera settings and starts the camera server.
* Sets up GPIO pins for relays, motion sensor, and keypad.

2.Mobile App (MIT App Inventor):

* The app allows users to control the relays, view the camera feed, and receive alerts.
* Communicates with Firebase to send and receive data.

3.Firebase Integration:

* Real-time database stores the state of each relay.
* Streams data to the ESP32-CAM to update relay states based on user commands.

4.User Authentication:

* Keypad input is processed and compared with predefined passwords.
* Correct password input unlocks the system, while incorrect input triggers an alert.

**Implementation Details**

1.ESP32-CAM Setup:

* Configures the camera, initializes WiFi, and connects to Firebase.
* Starts the HTTP server for camera streaming.

2.Relay Control:

* PCF8575 I/O expander is used to control six relays.
* Relays are toggled based on commands received from Firebase.

3.Motion Detection:

* PIR sensor is set up to detect motion and trigger alerts.
* When motion is detected, an image is captured and stored.

4.Keypad Security:

* 4x4 matrix keypad is used for password entry.
* LCD displays messages based on the status of the input (correct/incorrect).

5.Firebase Integration:

* The system streams data to and from Firebase to ensure real-time updates.
* Callback functions handle changes in the database and update the system accordingly.

**Mobile App (MIT App Inventor) Functionality**

  1.User Interface:
  
  * Buttons to control each relay.
  * Video feed display from the ESP32-CAM.
  * Notifications for motion detection and system status.
  
  2.Firebase Communication:
  
  * The app reads and writes data to Firebase to control the system.
  * Real-time synchronization ensures that the app and the system are always in sync.
  
**Conclusion**

This IoT-based home automation system provides a robust and flexible solution for remote home control and monitoring. By integrating the ESP32-CAM with Firebase and a custom-built mobile app, users can enhance their home security, convenience, and efficiency. The system's real-time capabilities and security features make it a valuable addition to any smart home setup.
